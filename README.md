# UnityButtonDropdown
An Unity UI Extension, a dropdown with buttons.

In any scene, in the hierarchy window, click on Create > UI > Button Dropdown (at the top). This creates a new dropdown menu to be moved around on the scene.

In the main settings of the Dropdown Manager script, attached to the Button Dropdown GameObject, you can change a couple of things. You can change the orientation of the dropdown by switching between Horizontal and Vertical. You can also change the colour of the background if you wish.

The open_close button in the Dropdown Manager script handles the opening and closing of the dropdown in editor mode. Everything can be changed in editor mode so that you can see what it would look like in-game. The open_close button refreshes the settings if it doesn't update.
